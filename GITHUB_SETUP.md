# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since GitHub CLI is not available in this environment, you'll need to create the repository manually. Follow these steps:

## Method 1: GitHub Web Interface

1. **Create Repository on GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com
   - Click "+" → "New repository"
   - Repository name: `html-to-wp-importer`
   - Description: `A powerful WordPress plugin that converts HTML files and ZIP archives into WordPress pages with Elementor integration`
   - Set to Public
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Push Code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   cd /home/z/my-project/instant-html-to-wp
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/html-to-wp-importer.git
   git push -u origin feature-complete-v1.0
   ```

## Method 2: Using GitHub API

If you have a GitHub personal access token, you can create the repository using curl:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_TOKEN with your actual credentials
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
     -d '{"name":"html-to-wp-importer","description":"A powerful WordPress plugin that converts HTML files and ZIP archives into WordPress pages with Elementor integration","private":false}' \
     https://api.github.com/user/repos

# Then add remote and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/html-to-wp-importer.git
git push -u origin feature-complete-v1.0
```

## Method 3: Manual Setup

1. **Create empty repository on GitHub**
2. **Add remote locally**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/html-to-wp-importer.git
   ```

3. **Push all branches**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   git push origin feature-complete-v1.0
   ```

4. **Set feature-complete-v1.0 as default branch** (in GitHub repository settings)

## Post-Creation Steps

After creating the repository, make sure to:

1. **Verify all files are pushed**
   ```bash
   git status
   git log --oneline
   ```

2. **Check repository on GitHub**
   - Visit https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/html-to-wp-importer
   - Verify all files are present
   - Check README.md displays correctly

3. **Add repository description and topics**
   - Add topics: wordpress, plugin, html-import, elementor, docker
   - Add website URL if applicable

4. **Enable GitHub Pages (optional)**
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Deploy from a branch → main/docs folder
   - Choose theme

## Branch Strategy

- **master**: Main branch (can be renamed to main)
- **feature-complete-v1.0**: Current feature-complete implementation
- **Future branches**: feature/v2.0, bugfix/issue-123, etc.

## Backup Verification

Before pushing, verify your backup exists:
```bash
ls -la /home/z/my-project/instant-html-to-wp-backup-*.tar.gz
```

You should see: `instant-html-to-wp-backup-20250831-172010.tar.gz`

## Final Checklist

- [ ] Repository created on GitHub
- [ ] Code pushed to feature-complete-v1.0 branch
- [ ] README.md displays correctly
- [ ] All files are present in repository
- [ ] Backup snapshot verified
- [ ] Repository description added
