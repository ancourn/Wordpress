- `process_html($html)` - Single HTML file processing
- `$imported_pages` - Tracks created page IDs for menu generation

#### HTML_WP_Assets  
- `process($source_dir)` - Copy assets to uploads directory
- `rewrite_urls($html)` - Rewrite asset URLs in HTML content
- `$assets_url` - Static property for asset URL storage

#### HTML_WP_Menu
- `build_menu($page_ids)` - Create navigation menu from imported pages

## üîß Technical Requirements and Dependencies

### System Requirements
- **WordPress**: 5.0 or higher
- **PHP**: 7.0 or higher  
- **PHP Extensions**: ZIP extension required
- **MySQL**: 5.6 or higher
- **Memory**: 64MB minimum (128MB recommended)

### WordPress Dependencies
- Uses core WordPress functions only
- No external plugins required
- Compatible with most WordPress themes
- Works with standard WordPress installation

### PHP Dependencies
- **ZipArchive**: For ZIP file processing
- **DOMDocument**: For HTML parsing
- **File System Functions**: For file operations
- **Standard PHP Libraries**: No external packages required

## üöÄ Current Workflow

### For ZIP Files
1. User uploads ZIP archive
2. Plugin extracts to temporary directory
3. Finds all HTML files (including subdirectories)
4. Processes each HTML file:
   - Extracts title from `<title>` tag
   - Extracts body content
   - Rewrites asset URLs
   - Creates WordPress page
5. Copies all assets to uploads directory
6. Creates navigation menu with all pages
7. Cleans up temporary files

### For Single HTML Files
1. User uploads HTML file
2. Plugin processes HTML content:
   - Extracts title from `<title>` tag
   - Extracts body content
   - Rewrites asset URLs
   - Creates WordPress page
3. Creates navigation menu with the page

## üêõ Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **File Size**: Limited by PHP upload limits (typically 2MB-8MB by default)
- **Memory Usage**: Large ZIP files may require increased memory limits
- **Complex HTML**: May have issues with heavily nested or malformed HTML
- **JavaScript**: Removes JavaScript from imported content for security
- **External Dependencies**: Does not handle external CDN resources

### Areas for Improvement
- **Progress Tracking**: No real-time progress feedback for large imports
